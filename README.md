**Doublets:**
Determines minimum chain of intermediate words required to bridge between an initial word and a target word of the same number of letters by changing one letter at a time. Each step must also be a valid word, and these are explored recursively with comaprison to a custom dictionary search.
**Minesweeper:**
Recursive minesweeper grid solver.
**Playfair:**
Playfair digraph substiution cipher.
**Sonnet:**
Identifies sonnet type in a file from the rhyming scheme. Uses a dictionary of words broken down into phonetic syllables, in order to compare word endings that are spelt differently but still rhyme.
**Stamp:**
Digital stamping for emails. The scheme works by making senders “pay” for every email they send by having to invest computational effort in the creation of a “digital stamp” added to email headers. The validity of the stamp can be verified by a receiver at negligible computational cost. The idea is to transfer the cost of spam from receivers to senders, thus rendering the business models of spam email senders unprofitable.
**Tube:**
Recursive tube map navigator.
